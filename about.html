<p>Hello!<br><br>

My name is Skyler and I am a student at Prime Digital Academy. This blogs’ purpose is to share what I’m learning as I’m learning it. I am one of the first 40 students to ever be accepted into Prime and I’m proud of it! I first found that I was interesting in Website Development when I was in college at MSU Moorhead (also a great school). I had a minor in Graphic Communications, so I was required to take a couple classes in web development. At first I was like “I’m never going to understand any of this!” but then I thrived! I was the student that other students were asking to help them. My roommate asked me multiple times to stay up late with her to help her with her projects because mine were already finished. I understood everything that was being thrown at me, OR I was asking the right questions so that I could understand the concept.<br><br>

I graduated from college May 2014 and was having a hard time finding a job in the field of Advertising, having no internship or other experience. I started looking for programs that could give me a masters degree or something that could give me a little boost of knowledge to see if I was really interested in a career in Web Development.<br><br>

Prime’s application process was long and time consuming but totally worth it! The Resume Challenge was the thing I was looking for to prove to myself that I loved web development! Then, I was accepted into the 2nd cohort at Prime Digital Academy!<br><br>

Each cohort has 20 students and 1 main instructor. Prime starts with a 6 week preload. This consists of online work that is mostly tutorials and challenges via code school. It’s a great way to ease into all the information. After the preload is the classroom portion. 12 weeks of in-classroom stuff. I haven’t started this part yet but boy am I excited to!</p>
<p>A quick disclaimer: This blog is just my interpertations of what I am learning as a student at Prime Digital Academy.
