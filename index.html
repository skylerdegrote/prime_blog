 		<p>JavaScript works with HTML and CSS; it adds behavior to the web page. In order to use JavaScript to it's full potential, you must understand HTML and CSS first. HTML is the structure of the page, CSS is the style and visual aspect of the site and JavaScript makes the webpage behave the way you want it to.</p>
 		<p>According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="blank">w3schools.com</a>, Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world. One of my favorite examples to show a small thing that javascript can do can be seen <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

 			<p>An HTML page with no CSS is just words. W3Schools.com does a really good just showing the different things you can do with CSS styling. HTML pages with no CSS are boring to look it. Below are some images from W3Schools.com to show some of the different styles that CSS can produce.</p>

 			<p><strong>What is HTML?</strong><br>
			HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the structural outline of a web page. Without CSS, an HTML page would just be words. No style, no font changes, no color at all. HTML is, however, very important to have. It includes the Head of the page which is needed to link the CSS to it and the Body of the page which includes the main content of the page. Within the Body can be the Header, Main, and Footer sections to separate the different parts of the web page and stay more organized.</p>
			<p><strong>What is CSS?</strong><br>
			CSS stands for Cascade Styling Sheets. CSS is the Style of the page. This includes: font styles, sizes and colors, and background colors and images. Different sections (like the header, main, and footer sections mentioned above) can, if you so choose, have different styles each. CSS is the overall appearance of the webpage. You can use CSS to control the style and layout of multiple Web pages all at once.</p>

 		<div class="post">
 			<p>According to Wikipedia, Software Development is the computer programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks involved in a software release life cycle and resulting in a software product. The term refers to a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.</p>

 			<p>I am one of the first 40 students to EVER be accepted to Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an accelerated program in Software Development. I am in week 5 of the preload portion and have learned a lot already. With only 1 week left of the online part, I am excited to be approaching the start of the 12 week in-classroom portion of Prime with 19 others. If you would like to look more into what Prime is exactly, just go to their website! This program has been amazing so far and I doubt that will change!</p>
