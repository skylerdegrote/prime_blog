 			As mentioned before, bootstrap has 12 columns. To use those columns you need to use the col-md-# format. This stands for column-screensize-number of columns. The screen sizes are represented with xs, sm, md, and lg. As shown below, these different screen sizes are meant to represent the different types of devices. <b>xs</b> is for phones, <b>sm</b> is for tablets, <b>md</b> (which I use in my examples) represents laptop computers and <b>lg</b> is for desktop monitors. When calling the column styling, you need to remember that these are all <b>lowercase</b>. Bootstrap will not understand the class if you use camel case or capital letters.

 			If you aren't the best at color or style, or don't know where to state when it comes to designing a webpage, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Boostrap</a>'s got your back. Bootstrap can be complicated but lets start by talking about the grid that is built into it. The grid has an automatic 12 columns. Below, is an image that shows you how you can split your content between those 12 columns.

 			The <b>$(document).ready(function( ) { }); </b>will basically check to see if the page has loaded fully, and <b>then</b> it will execute any part of the function's code block. You should have one of these in your JavaScript file. But you don't <b>have to</b> have all of your JavaScript code within the function.

 			The difference between <b>while loops</b> and <b>for loops</b> is not 100% clear to me. The way I understand it, while loops are for a little while and you don't know exactly how long and for loops will run for a specific amout of time. I do know that for loops are more commonly used.

 			<h2>Colors</h2>
 			<h4>Week 1</h4>
 			<h4>css</h4>
		</div>
 		<div class="post">
 		<p>
 			When choosing <b>colors</b> for a company or for on a website, you have to have an idea of how to call specific colors with your CSS code. Most programmers will use the hexadecimal layout. This contains 6 spots that follow a pound sign (#). The first two, as shown below, represent the color red, the second pair represents green and the third, blue. with the hexadecimal layout, you can use 0-9 and a-f. 0 means that that spot has none of the color, and with f, it has the most it can have of that color. For example: #000000 is Black and #ffffff is white. #ff0000 is red, #00ff00 is the greenest of greens and #0000ff is the bluest of blues.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			CSS also supports RGBA colors, HSL colors, and HSLA colors, which you can find more information about at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_colors.asp">W3Schools.com</a>.

 			Staying <b>DRY</b> with JavaScript can sometimes be difficult. DRY stands for <b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>epeat <b>Y</b>ourself. This basically just means that with JavaScript, you don't want to have code that is written over and over again with only a couple of changes in each section. There are some "best practices" when it comes to this that I don't think we've learned quite yet. So more on this later.

 			<h2>Function Structure</h2>

 		<div class="post">
 		<p>
 			<b>Functions</b> are a huge part of JavaScript as well. The main use for functions is to create a way to make the browser do something as a reaction to what the user is doing. For example: if the user clicks a button or a link, the browser does something. Using the proper structure in a function can make your career as a developer. If your functions break, then your webpage most likely won't do anything. Below, are two images representing 1) the correct structure of a function and 2)a good order to write your functions in. The second image is just an idea, and is not the only way to handle writing functions. It's showing that if you declare your variables that are needed in the function first, then write the logic and lastly write what the function should do and when, then you will have a good result pretty much every time.

 			<h2>Declaring a Variable</h2>
 			<h4>Week 1</h4>

 		<div class="post">
 		<p>
 			<b>Variables</b> are very important in JavaScript. The definition of a variable according to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">W3Schools.com</a> is</p> <blockquote>"Variables are containers for storing data values."</blockquote> <p>The keyword used to declare variables is <b>var</b>. This is a very imporatant part of javascript. When you declare a variable, you need to use the keyword "var" and also give the variable a name. The name can be anything you want but there are some important rules. Mainly, the best way to write a variable name is to use camelCase and try not to use numbers at the beginning or end of the name.camelCase is using a lowercase letter for the first word in the variable name and an uppercase letter for any following word. Do not use spaces in variable names!</p><p>one thing to be aware of is that you can declare a variable and not have a value attached to it right away. More into that later, though.

We had a similar group project yesterday as well. At the end of the project, we presented it to the class. This activity is both challenging and satisfying.

 			If/Else statements are very important and useful in JavaScript. They are called "Conditionals". A conditional statement is what you have an expression and you want to see if it is true or false. An if/else statement will let you *do some code* if the expression is true or *do some other code* if the expression is not true. In an if/else statement, you can have else many if else parts as you want. The image below demonstrates the structure of a basic if/else statement.

 		<p>JavaScript works with HTML and CSS; it adds behavior to the web page. In order to use JavaScript to it's full potential, you must understand HTML and CSS first.

 		<p>According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="blank">w3schools.com</a>, Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world.

 			<p><strong>What is HTML?</strong><br>
			HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the structural outline of a web page. Without CSS, an HTML page would just be words. No style, no font changes, no color at all. HTML is, however, very important to have. It includes the Head of the page which is needed to link the CSS to it and the Body of the page which includes the main content of the page. Within the Body can be the Header, Main, and Footer sections to separate the different parts of the web page and stay more organized.</p>
			<p><strong>What is CSS?</strong><br>
			CSS stands for Cascade Styling Sheets. CSS is the Style of the page. This includes: font styles, sizes and colors, and background colors and images. Different sections (like the header, main, and footer sections mentioned above) can, if you so choose, have different styles each. CSS is the overall appearance of the webpage. You can use CSS to control the style and layout of multiple Web pages all at once.</p>

 			<p>According to Wikipedia, Software Development is the computer programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks involved in a software release life cycle and resulting in a software product. The term refers to a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.</p>
