 			<h2>If/Else Statements - Structure</h2>

 		<div class="post">
 		<p>
 			If/Else statements are very important and useful in JavaScript. They are called "Conditionals". A conditional statement is what you have an expression and you want to see if it is true or false. An if/else statement will let you *do some code* if the expression is true or *do some other code* if the expression is not true. In an if/else statement, you can have else many if else parts as you want. The image below demonstrates the structure of a basic if/else statement.

 			The console is used mainly to test if your code is working. It's not needed. Using console.log() is mainly for the developer or to display a message to other developers. The console is also useful for finding and showing errors.

 		<p>JavaScript works with HTML and CSS; it adds behavior to the web page. In order to use JavaScript to it's full potential, you must understand HTML and CSS first. HTML is the structure of the page, CSS is the style and visual aspect of the site and JavaScript makes the webpage behave the way you want it to.</p>
 		<p>According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="blank">w3schools.com</a>, Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world. One of my favorite examples to show a small thing that javascript can do can be seen <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

 			<p><strong>What is HTML?</strong><br>
			HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the structural outline of a web page. Without CSS, an HTML page would just be words. No style, no font changes, no color at all. HTML is, however, very important to have. It includes the Head of the page which is needed to link the CSS to it and the Body of the page which includes the main content of the page. Within the Body can be the Header, Main, and Footer sections to separate the different parts of the web page and stay more organized.</p>
			<p><strong>What is CSS?</strong><br>
			CSS stands for Cascade Styling Sheets. CSS is the Style of the page. This includes: font styles, sizes and colors, and background colors and images. Different sections (like the header, main, and footer sections mentioned above) can, if you so choose, have different styles each. CSS is the overall appearance of the webpage. You can use CSS to control the style and layout of multiple Web pages all at once.</p>

 			<p>According to Wikipedia, Software Development is the computer programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications and frameworks involved in a software release life cycle and resulting in a software product. The term refers to a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.</p>

 			<p>I am one of the first 40 students to EVER be accepted to Prime Digital Academy. Prime is an accelerated program in Software Development. I am in week 5 of the preload portion and have learned a lot already. With only 1 week left of the online part, I am excited to be approaching the start of the 12 week in-classroom portion of Prime with 19 others. If you would like to look more into what Prime is exactly, just go to their website! This program has been amazing so far and I doubt that will change!</p>
